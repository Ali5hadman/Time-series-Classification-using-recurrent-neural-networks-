This project used deep learning techniques to analyze a dataset of time series
data in order to classify it into one of 12 different classes. Preprocessing techniques
such as data augmentation, including adding noise and windowing were done.
Various models, including LSTM and convolutional neural networks, and transformer
learning were employed in the analysis.
